                    BMI is not a perfect measure of body fat and can be misleading in some cases. For example, 
                    a muscular person may have a high BMI without being overweight (extra muscle adds to body weight â€” but not fatness). 
                    Also, BMI might be hard to interpret during puberty when kids have periods of fast growth.
                     Remember, BMI is usually a good indicator of body fat, but it's not a direct measurement.
