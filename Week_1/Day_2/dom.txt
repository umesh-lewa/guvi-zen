DOM stands for  Document Object Model
All web pages are are in this format
The DOM itself follows a tree structure.
the reason being in a tree structure searching for a
certain element is easier , and also it greatly reduces the 
time complexity for the operations, provided it is sorted in 
any logical order.
In JS we can perform dom manipulation via the elements
DOM is not something we see directly. It is internal to the web browser.
