There are two main compnents of a browser are render engine 
javascript engine. The render engine is the one that renders the
dom visually during runtime.
The javascript engine executes the javascript  code in the  browser.
different browsers use different engines  for both if the  above two engines.
Google chrome uses V8 engine, which is what node.js also uses.
So, node.js is simply a  way for you to execute js  code outside of
the browser in the server side.
