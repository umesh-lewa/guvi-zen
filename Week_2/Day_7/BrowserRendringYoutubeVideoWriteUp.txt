Rendring in browser,

parsing the html and the css gives the render tree  from which we get a layout

the dom tree is what we get from the html tags

link and style could halt the execution of javascript

we should always paste <script> tags at the bottom

CSS is represented as CSS Object Model , similar to dom, called CSSOM

So, render tree can be visualised as DOM + CSSOM

whatever does not need to be deisplayed visually does not go into render tree

In the final painting process , a bitmap is produced, this used to be done only by CPU,
now it has become GPU acclerated also
