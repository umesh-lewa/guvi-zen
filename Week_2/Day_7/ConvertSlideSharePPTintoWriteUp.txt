Server Response Status can be got from HTTP response codes,

HTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:

Informational responses (100–199),
Successful responses (200–299),
Redirects (300–399),
Client errors (400–499),
and Server errors (500–599).

No Network Connection,

 Network Errors
If a network error occurs while transmitting a request message, error information is available from the underlying network component; e.g. Windows Sockets or WinInet. Monitoring tools like HttpWatch can display error codes for situations such as:

The host name could not be converted into an IP address, perhaps because an invalid host name was used or because no DNS lookup service is available.
The browser could not connect to the web server. This may happen if the web server is not running or is listening on the wrong port.
The network connection may be broken while transmitting the request message, perhaps because a physical network connection has been interrupted, e.g. a network cable has been unplugged.

Server Response Content,

When the server responds with a JSON string, it tells the client that the message body contains JSON string with 'Content-Type: application/json' header.

for example the response code might be 200,

and the message might be,

{
    "success": "true"
}
